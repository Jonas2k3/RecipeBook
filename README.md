# RecipeBook

RecipeBook is a project to learn and get familiar with C#.

It involves reading and writing to and from JSON files, opening new application windows and communicating with data between those.

The app's goal is to allow users to store recipes and view them for instructions and/or ingredients.

The current and past issues can be found in the associated project board.
